                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Socrates believed that philosophy should achieve practical results for the greater well-being of society. 
                    He attempted to establish an ethical system based on human reason rather than theological doctrine. 
                </p>
                <p>Socrates pointed out that human choice was motivated by the desire for happiness. Ultimate wisdom comes from knowing oneself. 
                    The more a person knows, the greater his or her ability to reason and make choices that will bring true happiness.
